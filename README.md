# Ben-Sadler-Console-Finances

## Description 

In this challenge, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required activity. This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file.

The project User Story & acceptance criteria are as follows:

<ins>User Story </ins> <br><br>
AS A Trainee Front End Web developer
I WANT to create a script file using Javascript which processes financial data in an existing array including outputting data requested in acceptance criteria. 


<ins>The Acceptance Criteria </ins> <br>
1. Create a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.

**Hints:**

* You will need to do some research on your own for this project!

* Remember, in order to combine strings and variables in the console you will need to use **concatenation**.

* How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?
